description = "An annoying hex that paralyzes a hand of the caster's choice next turn, affecting the gestures.

The paralyzed hand repeats the same gesture it made last turn, except that W becomes P, S becomes D and C becomes F

Reapplying paralysis to an already paralyzed opponent is possible, but always affects the same hand as before.

Only one hex can be applied to a target in a turn: Otherwise they cancel each other out and have no effect.

As a hex, casting it on a monster prevents them from attacking that round."
