description = "An annoying hex that paralyzes a hand of the caster's choice next turn, affecting the gestures.\n\nThe paralyzed hand repeats the same gesture it made last turn, except that W becomes P, S becomes D and C becomes F\n\nReapplying paralysis to an already paralyzed opponent is possible, but always affects the same hand as before.\n\nOnly one hex can be applied to a target in a turn: Otherwise they cancel each other out and have no effect.\n\nAs a hex, casting it on a monster prevents them from attacking that round."
