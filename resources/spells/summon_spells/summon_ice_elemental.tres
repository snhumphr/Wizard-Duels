description = "Summons an ice elemental, which is hostile to all creatures, including the target.\n\nThe ice elemental has 3 hp, and attacks each turn for 3 [color=#739BD0]ice[/color] damage.\n\nOpposing elementals destroy one another immediately, while identical elementals merge into a single undamaged one.\n\nElementals are destroyed by spells of their opposite element, as well as by a 'storm' spell of their own element.\n\nUnlike most spells, this spell must have a target, and cannot be shot off into empty space."
