# Wizard-Duels

Wizard Duels is my personal adaptation of the [Spellbinder/Waving Hands rules by Richard Bartle](https://mud.co.uk/richard/spellbnd.html).
Although he has been kind enough to allow non-commercial adaptations of these rules, all rights regarding the ruleset still belong to him.

Some rules have been altered from their original version. Sometimes this is for my own mysterious reasons, but there are also several major balance and playability changes carried over from the [Ravenblack](https://games.ravenblack.net/rules/1/intro.html) strain of Spellbinder, which I quite enjoyed. All credit for those changes goes to that community.

If someone else wants to take this version and do something else with it, then you're welcome to, but you should credit what changes you took from me specifically(as I did here) and definitely not pass off the whole thing unchanged as your own.

# Ravenblack derived changes:

-Raise dead is removed
-Confusion is replaced with Maladroit, which forces both hands to make the same gesture
-Anti-spell is now S-P-F-P rather then S-P-F
-Paralysis is now cast either by F-D-F or D-F-D instead of by pure F-F-F
-Similarly, Disease now requires D-S-F-D-F-C instead of D-S-F-F-F-C

# Personal changes:

-The 'no gesture' symbol is now "N" for "Nothing" instead of "-", allowing for the use of "-" as a separator for improved readability
-Attempting to clap with a single hand now results in an "N" gesture with that hand, rather then the equally useless single "C" gesture
